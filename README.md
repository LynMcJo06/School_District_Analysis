# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 Pandas the work will be completed using this repo
Maria is a Chief Data Scientist for a city school district.  She is responsible for preparing all standardize test data for analysis, reporting and presentation.  This data will be used to provide insights into performance trends and patterns.  Our role is to assist Maria analyze data on student funding and student's standardized test scores.  We will be showcasing trends in school performance.  The school board and superintendent will use the information in making decisions on school budgets and priorities.  The data is highly confidential and must be protected.  
We are fairly new and Maria will provide assistance.  
We installed Anaconda as our analysis will be conducted using Python and Jupyter Notebook.   
We started by creating a development or virtual environment to be consistent with the other team members.  
We created a clone of the GitHub repository.  
We converted the Excel file to a Pandas DataFrame.

In 4.11 we established spending ranges per student, categorized the spending bins, grouped the data by the spending ranges and created a new DataFrame for the scores by school spending.  Our original breakdown of the spending bins had to be adjusted as the schools were not fairly grouped.  I was surprised by the results of the analysis:  the schools with the smallest per student spending had the highest Average and Percent Passing Math and Reading Scores, and the highest overall percentage passing.  
In Lession 12, we grouped the averages and percentages by school size as our client was curious if size had an impact on math and reading scores.  We created three bins, small, medium and large, for the school bins.  After created the three bins, we grouped the schools into the bins and added the results to our existing school summary.  Once again, we grouped the average math and reading scores, the average percentage passing math and reading, and the overall passing percentage based on school size.  The results of this analysis showed that attending a small to medium sized school produced higher scores and percentage.  The difference in overall percentage passing was shocking:  both small and medium size schools were 90% or better; the large schools dropped to 58%.
